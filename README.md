Orbitals
=============

Orbitals is based on the naive optimization process that Jared Tarbell has
implemented in his "[Happy
Place](http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/happyPlace/index.php)"
algorithm. Nodes are created in some, more or less structured arangement,
before they start to make friends with their neighbors. Gradually the nodes
make an effort to get closer to their friends, whilst at the same time keeping
a comfortable distance from the nodes they have not befriended.  The
visualization is made by drawing lines betweeen pairs of friends as they walk
around the canvas. Thus the final image is a history of all the friendships.

This is the fastest version. Probably.
